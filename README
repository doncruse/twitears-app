TwitEars
===========
This is a simple Twitter app that tells you who is likely to be listening to your @-reply conversations.

Background
==========
By default, you see some but not all @ replies in Twitter.  What you see are @ replies *from* people you subscribe that are sent *to* people you subscribe.  In other words, you see conversations of people where you are following both halves of the conversation.

You can change those settings.  You can turn off @ replies, but that loses most of the fun.  If you're a marketing pro, you can turn on all @ replies ... which gets too much info.
